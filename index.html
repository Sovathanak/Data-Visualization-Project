            <strong>Bangladesh</strong> maintained top 1 in terms of population density throughout
            the 70 years. <strong>Bangladesh</strong> had around <strong>316 people per km²</strong> 1950 which was already more twice
            as much as <strong>India</strong>'s and <strong>China</strong>'s population density combined. 
            <br><br>
            By year 2000, population density in <strong>Bangladesh</strong> passed <strong>1000 people per km²</strong> and peaked in 2020 where the population density rose to a whopping <strong>1346 people per km²</strong>.

        Looking into the age range of the population around the world, we can see that the age range of <strong>25 to 64</strong> is the majority
        age group, this is due to the massive range of 39 years as opposed to the ranges where it is only roughly 11 years. 
        <br><br>
        As we look over to the age range <strong>5 or under</strong> and <strong>5 to 14</strong>, the population in both age range doubled over time. 
        The population of <strong>5 or under</strong> and <strong>5 to 14</strong> started from
        <strong>338,496,583</strong> and <strong>531,111,819</strong> in 1950 to <strong>677,941,790</strong> and <strong>1,305,706,836</strong> in 2020.

        Corresponding to the data shown on the right, where
        <strong>Africa</strong> and <strong>Asia</strong> has the higher Child birth per 
        10,000 compared to other continents, it is evident here where the population growth 
        changes depending on Child birth. This is evident when we reach
        2019 and possibly onwards where the population growth rate in <strong>Africa</strong>
        is way ahead of other other continents as well as the global average with 
        <strong>2.472% </strong> by 2019, the growth rate is over 1% more than the global average.</p>

        <h2>World Age Range</h2>
        <p>
        By 2019, the Child mortality per 10,000 around the globe has seen a significant decrease
        especially in <strong>Africa</strong>, namely for countries like <strong>Mali</strong>, where it
        dropped to only <strong>94</strong> compared to a whopping <strong>405</strong> in 1950. Despite the
        significant drop in Child mortality per 10,000 in <strong>Africa</strong>, the Child birth per 10,000 has stayed roughly the same
        amount compared to previous years.
